AI Venture Architect — multi-agent system for market research & AI product ideation (CrewAI + LangGraph) 

 

1) Product Description & Presentation 

One-liner 

“An autonomous team of AI agents that scouts markets, analyzes trends, and invents profitable AI product ideas—before your competitors even see them coming.” 

What it produces 

Market Intelligence Packs: trend scans, growth signals, whitespace analysis, competitor matrices. 

Validated Product Briefs: one-liner, UVP, ICPs/personas, problem hypotheses, MVP & v1.0 feature sets. 

Business Model Blueprints: TAM/SAM/SOM, pricing strategies, CAC/LTV heuristics, channel fit. 

Tech Feasibility & Costing: recommended stacks, API options, infra cost curves, privacy/compliance notes. 

Go-to-Market Plans: positioning, wedge strategy, lighthouse customers, experiment backlogs. 

Investor-Ready Artifacts: pitch-style PDF/Notion pages, CSV assumptions, JSON bundles. 

Continuous Discovery: weekly/monthly “Top Opportunities” digests with deltas vs. last run. 

Scope/Safety 

Decision-support, not financial/legal advice. All claims trace to sources with citations. 

Bias checks (source diversity, recency gates) and risk flags (regulatory, data sensitivity). 

Read-only connectors by default; on-prem and VPC options for enterprise data. 

 

2) Target User 

Startup founders, venture studios, solopreneurs. 

VC/angel analysts scouting investable theses. 

Enterprise strategy/innovation teams. 

Agencies/consultancies producing product roadmaps for clients. 

 

3) Features & Functionalities (Extensive)

Sources (configurable): Crunchbase/funding feeds, Product Hunt, app stores (iOS/Google Play), GitHub trending & repo metadata, arXiv/SSRN, news/RSS, Google Trends, Reddit/Twitter (X) topic streams, G2/Capterra reviews, Statista/CB Insights (paid), Glassdoor (org signals). 

Artifacts: company profiles, product pages, pricing pages, reviews, release notes, commits, papers, funding rounds, hiring signals, traffic ranks. 

Normalization: entity resolution (company, product, category), dedup by URL+fingerprint, currency & unit normalization, locale/date harmonization. 

Versioning: snapshot tables with effective_from/to; diff views for price/feature changes. 

Enrichment 

Taxonomies & NER: industries (NAICS/GICS), AI technique tags (LLM, CV, RL, ASR…), monetization types, ICP roles. 

Topic modeling & clustering: HDBSCAN/BERTopic over signals to surface emergent themes. 

Knowledge graph: company↔product↔feature↔investor edges; centrality/novelty metrics. 

Unit parsing: ARR ranges, MAU/WAU, growth %, pricing tiers into normalized fields. 

Retrieval & Analysis 

Hybrid search: BM25 + dense embeddings + cross-encoder re-rank over signals & documents. 

Trend kinetics: slope/acceleration of mentions/adoption; change-point detection. 

Competitor benchmarking: feature coverage, pricing ladders, traction proxies, moat signals. 

Whitespace/gap analysis: unmet needs vs. current solutions; JTBD mapping from reviews/forums. 

Geo/regulatory overlays: constraints/opportunities by region/sector. 

Idea Generation 

Ideation agent: synthesizes problem→solution concepts; proposes UVP and differentiation. 

Feature stratification: MVP (4–6 must-haves), premium/enterprise add-ons, roadmap stages. 

Positioning matrix: price vs. capability; wedge → beachhead → expansion sequence. 

Validation & Scoring 

Market modeler: TAM/SAM/SOM with scenario bands; bottoms-up & top-down triangulation. 

Unit economics: pricing candidates, CAC channels, LTV drivers; sensitivity analysis. 

Tech feasibility: stack options, API availability, build-vs-buy, latency/cost tradeoffs. 

Risk & compliance: data residency, safety/abuse surfaces, sector-specific regs. 

Composite Attractiveness Score: weighted (market × pain severity × feasibility × moatability), with confidence bands. 

Views & Reporting 

Opportunity Explorer: filters by sector, traction proxy, capital intensity, payback time. 

Idea Sheets: canvas-style single page; links to sources & assumptions. 

Deck & Doc Exports: PDF/PowerPoint/Notion; CSV of metrics; JSON bundle. 

Rules & Automations 

Saved watches (e.g., “AI for logistics”), weekly digests, delta alerts (pricing change, breakout trend). 

Auto-refresh of top N ideas per workspace; notify subscribers. 

Collaboration & Governance 

Workspaces, roles (Owner/Admin/Member/Viewer), share links with expiring tokens. 

Commenting, review states, lockable assumptions; full audit trail. 

 

4) Backend Architecture (Extremely Detailed & Deployment-Ready) 

4.0 Multi-Agent Framework & Orchestration 

Primary framework: CrewAI for role-based agents, tool use, and collaborative planning/execution. 

Control flow & state: LangGraph for graph-structured workflows, retries, branching, and iterative refinement loops. 

Pattern: Each CrewAI agent (Research, Competitor, Ideation, Business, Tech, Validation, Export) is a LangGraph node. Edges encode success/failure/insufficient-evidence paths. Shared state persists to Postgres/LanceDB. 

Memory: RAG over workspace knowledge (assumptions, prior ideas, saved signals) with LanceDB/pgvector. 

Budgeting/guardrails: token/rate budgets per run; tool allow-lists per agent; deterministic “facts first” step before generation. 

4.1 Topology 

Frontend/BFF: Next.js 14 (SSR for dashboards, Server Actions for signed uploads/exports, ISR for public share links). 

API Gateway: FastAPI (Python 3.11) — REST /v1 (OpenAPI 3.1), Problem+JSON errors, RBAC (Casbin), Idempotency-Key, Request-ID (ULID). 

Workers (Python + CrewAI/LangGraph) 

ingest-worker (crawlers, APIs, cleaning) 

normalize-worker (entities, currencies, snapshots) 

trend-worker (topic clusters, kinetics) 

competitor-worker (pricing/feature diffs) 

ideation-worker (concepts, UVP, features) 

business-worker (TAM/SAM/SOM, unit econ, scenarios) 

tech-worker (stack options, cost curves) 

validation-worker (risks, compliance, scoring) 

export-worker (PDF/Notion/CSV/JSON bundles) 

Event bus/queues: NATS subjects: signals.ingest, signals.normalize, trends.detect, bench.run, idea.generate, model.business, model.tech, validate.run, export.make; DLQ via Redis Streams. 

Datastores 

Postgres 16 + pgvector for embeddings/metadata (RLS by workspace_id) 

OpenSearch/Elasticsearch for keyword & aggregations 

LanceDB (optional) for local vector experimentation 

S3/R2 for raw artifacts & exports 

Redis for cache/session/rate-limits 

Neo4j (optional) for market graphs; ClickHouse (optional) for usage analytics 

Observability: OpenTelemetry traces/metrics/logs → Prometheus/Grafana; Sentry for errors. 

Secrets: Cloud KMS; per-connector API keys; encryption at rest with per-workspace keys.

APIs/Workers: Render/Fly.io/GKE pools per worker type; autoscale by queue depth. 

DB: Managed Postgres + pgvector; PITR; read replicas for analytics. 

Search: Managed OpenSearch/Elasticsearch with snapshots. 

Cache/Bus: Redis + NATS; DLQ with backoff/jitter. 

Storage/CDN: S3/R2 + CloudFront/Cloudflare for exports. 

CI/CD: GitHub Actions (lint, typecheck, unit/integration, Docker build, image scan/sign, deploy); blue/green; db migration approvals. 

IaC: Terraform modules for DB/Search/Redis/NATS/buckets/secrets/DNS. 

Envs: dev/staging/prod; feature flags; error budgets & paging. 

Operational SLOs 

Time-to-Top-3 ideas (full run): < 60s p95. 

Deck export: < 10s p95. 

Search API p95: < 1.2s. 

Pipeline success: ≥ 99% monthly. 

 

8) Testing 

Unit: NER accuracy on product/pricing; topic clustering quality; currency/unit parsers. 

Retrieval: recall@k for benchmarked opportunity corpora; ablations (keyword vs hybrid vs rerank). 

Ideation: rubric-based human eval with blinded panels; inter-rater reliability. 

Business modeling: sanity bounds; scenario consistency; Monte Carlo coverage. 

Integration: ingest → cluster → benchmark → ideate → validate → export. 

E2E (Playwright): user creates watch → receives digest → opens idea → exports deck. 

Load: concurrent runs, backpressure behavior, queue spillover. 

Chaos: connector outage, stale API keys, search node loss; retries/backoff correctness. 

Security: RLS coverage; secrets scope; audit log completeness. 

 

9) Success Criteria 

Product KPIs 

≥ 80% of ideas rated “actionable” by pilot founders/VCs. 

≥ 25% of weekly surfaced ideas move to experiment design. 

Digest open rate ≥ 60%, click-through ≥ 20%. 

Time saved vs manual research: ≥ 4× on average. 

Engineering SLOs 

Error rate < 0.5% of runs; p95 latencies within targets. 

Data freshness: < 24h for tracked sources; alerts on staleness. 

 

10) Visual/Logical Flows 

A) Ingest & Normalize 

 Connectors → fetch → clean/normalize → dedup → embed → store signals (Postgres/pgvector) → index (OpenSearch). 

B) Market Analysis 

 Signals → topic clustering & kinetics → competitor diffing → whitespace map → geo/reg overlays. 

C) Multi-Agent Ideation (CrewAI + LangGraph) 

 Research agent summarizes evidence → Ideation agent drafts concepts → Business agent models TAM/SAM/SOM & unit econ → Tech agent proposes stack & cost → Validation agent scores & flags risks → (loop on low-confidence nodes until thresholds met). 

D) Reporting & Automation 

 Idea approved → Export worker renders deck/JSON/CSV → Share → Watches schedule next run → Weekly digest with deltas. 

 

Framework note (explicit): The system is built on CrewAI for agent roles & collaboration and LangGraph for stateful, fault-tolerant DAGs (branching, retries, memory). This combination gives you human-auditable steps, deterministic control over loops/terminations, and scalable execution across workers—ideal for “research → reason → validate → export” workflows.
